## Assignment instructions
In this exercise you will create a Connect Four game using React. Connect Four is a game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid.<br/>

The game should be implemented in React and the players drop discs into the columns by clicking on the grid. When a column is filled, it should not be possible to drop into that column again. <br/>

A player wins when four discs of the same color are connected (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). It is important that the logic for checking the winner is implemented correctly.<br/>

When a player wins, the game should display a message and it should not be possible to continue playing. If the game is a draw, the game should show a message.<br/>

A "reset" button should be displayed after the game is over.
